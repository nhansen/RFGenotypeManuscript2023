The IGSR has sequenced 3,202 samples from the thousand genomes project to
roughly 30x per sample (Byrska-Bishop et al., 2022). This resource includes
2,504 unrelated individuals and 602 complete family trios, with Illumina
sequencing data available at 
(URL)

In addition, structural variant genotype calls from three algorithms
(GATK-SV, svtools, and Absinthe) were integrated using a machine learning
algorithm as part of Byrska-Bishop et al. and can be downloaded from:
http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20210124.SV_Illumina_Integration/1KGP_3202.gatksv_svtools_novelins.freeze_V3.wAF.vcf.gz

Population allele frequencies and de novo rates within trios were 
calculated using the shell script sh.tally_allelefreqs_and_denovos,
which calls the perl script calc_superpop_freqs_and_denovo_rate.pl on
both the Byrska-Bishop genotypes and the ones generated by our model,
and results are included in the AlleleFreqsAndDenovos subdirectory.
